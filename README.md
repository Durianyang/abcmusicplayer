This piece of software was written for MIT's 6.005. It takes in a .abc file, parses through it, and plays it. It was <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21ImmTL05SM> outrageous fun </a> to put together, but more importantly, it is:

1) Safe from change
2) Ready for bugs
3) Difficult to understand
